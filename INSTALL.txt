Installing
=========

Download the archive and extract it. That you most likely have already done since you're reading this document.
Installing can be done by

    ``python setup.py install``

or if you want to install under $HOME

    ``python setup.py install --user``


Installing required software
=========

Everything has been written and tested using Python3, but those dependencies have problems in Ubuntu. Seems like
this works on Python2 as well.

Ubuntu
-------------

Starting from Ubuntu 14.04 all the dependencies can be installed straight from package-manager. This apt-get one-liner
should install everything necessary

    ``sudo apt-get install cython dcraw imagemagick sextractor python-imaging python-astropy python-skimage python-configparser``

Or if you intend to use Python 3

    ``sudo apt-get install cython3 dcraw imagemagick sextractor python3-imaging python3-astropy python3-skimage python-configparser``

This assumes you have the newest full Ubuntu desktop installed. If you have customized your installation, other packages
might be required as well.

Newer versions of Python packages can be installed via pip (python-pip in package manager). For example

    ``pip install --upgrade --user numpy

The switch --user installs package into $HOME, so it won't mess up your system. Without that you need sudo in front
of that command.



Debian (Under construction. Instructions probably doesn't work. Refer to Ubuntu instructions)
-------------

This oneliner ought install most of the required software

    ``apt-get install dcraw sextractor libtiff5-dev imagemagick numpy python3-pip python3-pyopencl``

AstroPy can be installed now with

    ``pip-3.2 install astropy``

as root or

    ``pip-3.2 install --user astropy``

if you want the installation on users $HOME.

Also Python packages Pillow and Cython have to be installed with pip

    ``pip-3.2 install cython``
    ``pip-3.2 install pillow``

Gentoo
------------
AstroPy and SExtractor are in Science overlay, so that has to be activated. Easiest way is to use Layman

    ``emerge layman``

and activate the overlay by

    ``layman -a science``

After that all the requirements can be installed with

    ``emerge dcraw sextractor imagemagick exiftool astropy numpy cython pyopencl``

Some of these might be ~arch and require unmasking, but as a Gentoo user you might know how to get around it
