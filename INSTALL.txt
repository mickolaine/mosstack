Installing
=========

Download the archive and extract it. That you most likely have already done since you're reading this document.
Installing can be done by

    ``python setup.py install``

or if you want to install under $HOME

    ``python setup.py install --user``


Installing required software
=========

Everything has been written and tested using Python3. The program itself works on Python 2, but some libraries are
under different names and I think it's too much hassle to support both. Modern Linux distributions have a good support
for Python 3 so I've dropped support for version 2.

Ubuntu
-------------

If you're using Ubuntu 14.04 you can use my PPA. Just open terminal and type

    ``sudo add-apt-repository ppa:mikko-laine/pyastrostack``

You might receive an error regarding GPG fingerprint. You can ignore until I find out how to fix that.

After adding the repository just

    ``sudo apt-get install mosstack``

And apt will install everything necessary.



Ubuntu manual install
--------------

Starting from Ubuntu 14.04 all the dependencies can be installed straight from package-manager. This apt-get one-liner
should install everything necessary

    ``sudo apt-get install cython3 dcraw imagemagick sextractor python3-imaging python3-astropy python3-skimage python-configparser``

This assumes you have the newest full Ubuntu desktop installed. If you have customized your installation, other packages
might be required as well.

Newer versions of Python packages can be installed via pip (python-pip in package manager). For example

    ``pip install --upgrade --user numpy``

The switch --user installs package into $HOME, so it won't mess up your system. Without that you need sudo in front
of that command.


Debian Wheezy
-------------

Mosstack requires Python 3 and Debian Wheezy does not include many required Python libraries for version 3. It is
required to manually install several of them with the tool pip.

    ``apt-get install python3-pip``

Also other packages need to be installed from package manager before using pip any further. Here's a oneliner to do help
with that:

    ``apt-get install dcraw sextractor libtiff5-dev imagemagick python3-pyqt4``

Pip is used like this:

    ``pip3.2 install <package>``

or as user

    ``pip3.2 install --user <package>``

Required packages are

    numpy
    scipy
    astropy
    pillow
    cython

If you have a working OpenCL installation, you can use it with mosstack. Enable it with by installing pyopencl with
Pip.

    ``pip3.2 install pyopencl``

Now to installing mosstack. Since you are reading this you probably have already extracted the source package. Now
simply

    ``python3 setup.py install``

or as user

    ``python3 setup.py install --user``

in the extracted directory root.

Or as copy & paste commands:

    ``tar xvf mosstack-0.5.tar.gz``
    ``cd mosstack-0.5``
    ``python3 setup.py install --user``


Debian Jessie
------------
Jessie lacks one required package. Scikit-image for Python 3 is needed for affine transformations. This can be obtained
by some 3rd party repositories or with Pip. Install pip with

    ``apt-get install python3-pip``

and install Scikit-image with

    ``pip3 install scikit-image``

Add switch "--user" if you wish to install to users home directory.

Now you can install AstroStack with .deb file found in

    ``dpkg -i mosstack.deb``
    ``apt-get -f install``

The latter takes care of all the dependencies not installed.

On manual install, please refer to instructions for Debian Wheezy.


Debian Sid
------------
Sid (at least on 2014-08-24) has all the required libraries on package manager. mosstack can be installed manually
as instructed for Debian Wheezy, or with .deb package downloaded from

After downloading, simply

    ``dpkg -i mosstack.deb``
    ``apt-get -f install``


Gentoo
------------
Several required libraries are in Science overlay, so that has to be activated. Easiest way is to use Layman

    ``emerge layman``

and activate the overlay by

    ``layman -a science``

Ebuild for mosstack is also in Science overlay. It's marked ~amd64 so it has to be unmasked. If you use Gentoo, you
probably are familiar with that.

    ``emerge moss``

and portage will take care of all the dependencies.
