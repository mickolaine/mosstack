Installing
=========

Download the archive and extract it. That you most likely have already done since you're reading this document.
Installing can be done by

    ``python setup.py install``

or if you want to install under $HOME

    ``python setup.py install --user``

Note that command python should run python3 and python2 won't work. If you have python2 as default python interpreter,
running the script

    ``python3 setup.py install --user``

might work.

Installing required software
=========

Debian and Ubuntu (and perhaps derivatives)
-------------

This oneliner ought install most of the required software

    ``apt-get install dcraw sextractor imagemagick numpy python3-pip``

Rawtran is installed by following instructions in
<http://integral.physics.muni.cz/rawtran/>

AstroPy can be installed now with

    ``pip-3.2 install astropy``

as root or

    ``pip-3.2 install --user astropy``

if you want the installation on users $HOME

Gentoo
------------
AstroPy and SExtractor are in Science overlay, so that has to be activated. Easiest way is to use Layman

    ``emerge layman``

and activate the overlay by

    ``layman -a science``

After that all the requirements can be installed with

    ``emerge dcraw sextractor imagemagick exiftool astropy numpy cython pyopencl``

Some of these might be ~arch and require unmasking, but as a Gentoo user you might know how to get around it
