This file will eventually explain the whole process of stacking astronomical
images with pyAstroStack. For now I only copy & paste important information I
need to remember.

#### Converting images ####
My intention is that pyAstroStack could handle all kinds of images as its
input. At the moment it assumes everything is DSLR's raw-photos and runs
everything through rawtran.
Rawtran converts raw-images with DCRaw into FITS format. Fits is great with
astronomical data and it's easy to handle with AstroPy.

Command "dcraw -T -4 -t 0 -D tiedosto.pääte" should be what I need if I wanted
to use dcraw itself.


#### Extracting stellar data ####
Input images are assumed to have a lot of stars in them. Aligning images so
that all the stars are in same places on every photo requires coordinates of
several stars from each image. I do this with SExtractor.
Running SExtractor returns coordinates of several stars (depending on settings
maybe from 20 to 20000 or even more). The pattern matching algorithm says its
running time is proportional to n^4.5 where n is number of stars. That's why
SExtractor need to be set so it finds max 40 stars. That's more than enough for
pattern matching to work.


#### Pattern matching ####
SExtractor gives xy-coordinates of all the stars in an image. This information
will somehow be processed into geometric translation and rotation information.
This article seems to hold all the necessary information:
