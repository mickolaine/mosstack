This file will eventually explain the whole process of stacking astronomical
images with pyAstroStack. For now I only copy & paste important information I
need to remember.




#### Pattern matching ####
SExtractor gives xy-coordinates of all the stars in an image. This information
will somehow be processed into geometric translation and rotation information.
This article seems to hold all the necessary information:

Now all I have to do is read and understand that.
