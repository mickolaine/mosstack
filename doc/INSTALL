This document will explain how to install pyAstroStack. For now, it only
contains list of dependencies. PyAstroStack relies heavily on other open source
projects and actually for now it could be considered only as a script to
automate some tasks. My intention is to make a full program with GUI and all,
but since my programming experience and time to do this are heavily limited,
I can't promise anything.


PyAstroStack will need these to work

Rawtran - http://integral.physics.muni.cz/rawtran/
This will convert raw photos into fits-files. The task could probably be done
with just Dcraw, but I'll see about changing that behaviour later on. Rawtran
does the stuff for now. I couldn't find this on any distro so you'll have to
install it manually.

DCRaw - http://www.cybercom.net/~dcoffin/dcraw/
Rawtran requires this. This can be found on any Linux distribution.

AstroPy - http://www.astropy.org/
For now I'm only using PyFITS from this package, but since authors of PyFITS
recommend using AstroPy, that's what I'll do. I'll try to change behaviour of
my programs so that it checks which one is installed, AstroPy or just PyFITS
and use the one found. Gentoo has this on Portage, but Ubuntu does not. Can be
installed with pip (http://www.pip-installer.org/en/latest/) by running
"pip install astropy". Pip can be found on several distros

NumPy - http://www.numpy.org/
AstroPy requires this. Also used by straight import in order to fiddle with
numpy.arrays. This should be in your distros package manager.
