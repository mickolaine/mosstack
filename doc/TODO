0.9
- Automated tests
- Rework the gui. Either totally new or improve the old


0.8

- Drop DCRaw
- Drop ImageMagick
- Drop OpenCL
- Make Gui and Cli use the same threading workers and mostly the same methods
  Minimize code duplication.
   - For example QBatch.register should call Batch.register and only add
     what Gui needs
- Rename everything to conform pylints requests.
- Clean CommandLine.py workflow by moving stuff to Batch and make assisting
  methods which CommandLine.start() calls
- Related to above. Make Batch processes work with calling method without
  arguments eg. Batch.stack(). Everything it requires should be anyways 
  already set.
- Begin work on automated tests
- Remove obsolete stuff
- Make decision on new gui
- Hot pixels detection and removal
- CompressedData. Test speed. What's this? Can't remember anymore
- Work up the environment. Virtualenv, pipenv and such.
- Unify QFrame with Frame and QBatch with Batch so they use as much
  the same code as possible. Now everything seems to be written twice


0.7

+ Done: New CLI
  + something is different with adding files and loading them. Stacking works if you first add files and calibrate
    with separate command. If add files and calibrate within single command stacking fails on calibration.


0.6

+ DONE: Clean scripts/mosstack to include only the necessary and move all the
  functionality to UserInterface.py
+ DONE: Change both GUI and CLI to use the same methods
+ DONE: Registering should be fully independent from other parts of the
  program.
+ DISABLED: Remove ImageMagick's affine transform if necessary
+ DONE: Add support for python-magic
+ DONE: Implement reference frame
+ DONE: Implement removal of frames from project
+ DONE: Fix id assigning for frames in batch. Now it calculates number of
  frames and takes n+1. This will fail if you remove frames
+ DONE: Config.py multithreads
