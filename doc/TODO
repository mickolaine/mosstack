List of TODO's too big to be in a single line comment

0.6

+ DONE: Clean scripts/mosstack to include only the necessary and move all the
  functionality to UserInterface.py
+ DONE: Change both GUI and CLI to use the same methods
+ DONE: Registering should be fully independent from other parts of the
  program.
+ DISABLED: Remove ImageMagick's affine transform if necessary
+ DONE: Add support for python-magic
+ DONE: Implement reference frame
+ DONE: Implement removal of frames from project
+ DONE: Fix id assigning for frames in batch. Now it calculates number of
  frames and takes n+1. This will fail if you remove frames



0.7

- Redesign Config.py and the whole configuration system:
  On 0.6 it works:
   - Config._set() reads file, does its changes, writes file, things remain in memory
   - Config.get() makes sure all _set():s are committed, reads file, returns, things remain in memory
  Notice how file gets read on every commit and request even though everything stays in memory. Queue and Thread
  do get around this (starting from 0.6), but with more sensible design those wouldn't necessarily be needed.
  It should work:
   - Load information from file in __init__() and keep it in memory
   - get() returns information from memory
   - set() changes information in memory AND writes it to file AND keeps it in memory
   - No simultaneous accesses to file will happen since there is only one Config object per file
