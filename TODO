Roadmap

- Make Gui and Cli use the same threading workers and mostly the same methods
  Minimize code duplication.
   - For example QBatch.register should call Batch.register and only add
     what Gui needs
- Rename everything to conform pylints requests.
- Clean CommandLine.py workflow by moving stuff to Batch and make assisting
  methods which CommandLine.start() calls
- Begin work on automated tests
- Remove obsolete stuff
- Make decision on new gui

0.9
- Automated tests
- Rework the gui. Either totally new or improve the old
