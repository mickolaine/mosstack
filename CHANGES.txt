v0.1.1, 2014-02-27 -- Bugfixes and adjustable settings
- Fixed a bug in registering which for some reason had no effect on the result
  and made registering faster. Now it's a bit slower but the algorithm is
  correct.
- Some speed improvement in registering by optimizing the code.
- Altered stellar extraction algorithms so that they find 20-25 stars for every
  frame, not just the reference. This speeds up registering because now there
  won't be >40 star frames
- Algorithms for registering, demosaicing, and stacking can now be chosen with
  commands list and set
