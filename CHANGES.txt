v0.5.0
- Redesigned Frame - Batch relationship and added QFrame and QBatch to use
  with PyQt4 gui
- Multithreading on GUI. Somewhat working.
- Program icons added
- Executable names changed from camel case to lower case

v0.4.1 2014-07-30 -- Bugfix
- Gui now checks for pyopencl and does not assume it exists. This affects the
  gui only since cli already checks for opencl before use

v0.4.0 2014-05-23 -- Gui and sigma stacks
- Added sigma clipping and sigma median stacking methods where values that
  differ more than 3 times the standard deviation from the median are either
  ignored (clipped) or replaced with the median value
- Deactivated "Legacy" stacking method which is identical to Groth_ImageMagick,
  but a monolithic file. Code still exists.
- Deactivated debayering methods written in pure Python. They were slow and
  written only for testing purposes. Code still exists.
- Unified naming scheme of everything related to debayering. Every "demosaic"
  word has been replaced with "debayer". Also the methods now have used
  language as suffix, eg. BilinearOpenCl or VNGCython.
- Changed names of executable scripts to have no .py suffix. This complies with
  Debian standards and indeed is a better practise
- Added first version of graphical user interface written in PyQt4

v0.3.0 2014-04-08 -- Some more fixes and a bigger bump
- Fixed a lot of bugs caused by all the previous changes
- Realized there are so many new features that a bigger version bump is
  in place.

v0.2.5 2014-04-08 -- Affine transformation by Scipy
- Added affine transformation by SciPy. This makes so many things so much
  easier, because now only one intermediate file format is required.
- Changed temporary datatype to uint16 instead of int16.

v0.2.4 2014-04-04 -- Registering improvements
- Fixed Cythoning on _step2.pyx. Now many percent faster. Such speed. Wow.
- Split Sextractor2 into Groth.py, IM_transform.py and Sextractor.py so
  individual parts can be used elsewhere and changing them is easier.
- Groth does not extract and match stars if it's already done. Information
  stored in frame info file
- Added prints to operations so user knows names for resulting files
- Fixed memory leak on Registering operations

v0.2.3, 2014-04-02 -- VNG on Cython
- Variable number of gradients debayering ported to Cython. This is also the
  new default

v0.2.2, 2014-04-01 -- Cython debayering and Ubuntu support
- Wrote bilinear debayering on Cython to see how fast it can get. Surprisingly
  good results on speed, but as a method it's not too good
- Changed BilinearCython to the default debayering method so OpenCl is not
  a requirement anymore.
- Ubuntu 14.04 seems to have ImageMagick 6.7 which didn't work as expected, or
  as 6.8 did. Now program tests for ImageMagick version and works accordingly.

v0.2.1, 2014-03-29 -- Bugfixes, what else?
- Fixed a bug with Python 2.x in Frame._release_data().
- Updated CHANGES.txt on versions 0.2.0 and 0.2.1 because I forgot it the last
  time.
- Cut 5% off the SExtractor2 registering method

v0.2.0, 2014-03-28 -- Some rewrite of existing classes
- Replaced class Photo with class Frame. Frame has a lot better design, less
  redundancy and better support for frame info files. This work is prelude to
  creating a GUI.
- Unified Debayering classes to have similar structure.
- Altered Debayering classes to take numpy.array of image as argument instead
  of full Photo object. This makes them easier to port to other programs.
  Also fixed the Bilinear and BilinearCl to use proper bayer matrix.
- Made informational prints to be little more consistent.

v0.1.1, 2014-02-27 -- Bugfixes and adjustable settings
- Fixed a bug in registering which for some reason had no effect on the result
  and made registering faster. Now it's a bit slower but the algorithm is
  correct.
- Some speed improvement in registering by optimizing the code.
- Altered stellar extraction algorithms so that they find 20-25 stars for every
  frame, not just the reference. This speeds up registering because now there
  won't be >40 star frames
- Algorithms for registering, Debayering, and stacking can now be chosen with
  commands list and set

v0.1.0, 2014-02-22 -- First public version.
